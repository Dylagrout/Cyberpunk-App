    popularStory: ["A scathing critique on a policy implemented by the local government. It sparked a larger discussion and even protests on the issue. The law is still in place, but at least there are efforts to reverse it, and people are aware of what it's costing them.", "Review of a new gen of cyberware. Your honest and detailed insights into the tech were highly praised by consumers, even if the corp would have preferred some more enthusiastic language. All in all, everyone was happy, and that's a rare thing.", "An advice column responding to a reader experiencing some relationship drama. Your heartfelt advice and caring vibe resonated with many readers. Your inbox did flood with some truly unhinged relationship drama after that point, though.", "A slow-news-day story about some gonk you saw on the street. It was a silly opinion piece to fill up some empty space or dead air. Somehow, this turned a random, if eccentric, individual into a kind of cryptid, with people reporting on sightings and coming up with all sorts of lore for the poor bastard. You just hope the sop got something out of it.", "A deep dive into a local gang. Showcasing their everyday lives, their work and culture. Some would definitely call it propaganda, but they have no idea just how much you had to cut, how much you had to beg to keep in. It was an interesting experience to say the least, and weirdly enough… you’ve had some offers from other gangs, looking for the same star treatment.", "You had a story that promised to be massive. An absolutely insane web of political intrigue and juicy celebrity gossip. Unfortunately, what showed all the signs of a monster hit turned out to be a massive misunderstanding; a complete non-starter. But… a choom’s gotta pay the bills. You embellished what you’d found into a story worth publishing, and it turns out you can spin quite the yarn if you want to! It was a raging success. For whatever reason, those involved didn’t seem to give two shits. In fact, they’ve made it clear that - should you ever come clean - there would be… consequences.", "A story highlighting a fundraiser for a local kid, a veteran, or another person in need. You led the charge in getting them help, capturing a moment of the community truly coming together for once. You got precious little out of it in the way of eddies, but it's something you can be proud of.",
        "An investigative piece looking into a nomad clan. Whilst you’d aimed to show them in a more positive light, the whole thing backfired hard. The story garnered thousands of views, shares and comments, containing some of the most vitriolic bullshit you’ve ever read. The ad revenue landed you a decent chunk of cha-ching, but it’s up to you how important that really was.", "A Fixer paid you a pile of eddies to compile a series of fake fluff pieces under several aliases, selling one of their crew as some bigshot corpo to help with some kind of infiltration. It got a little out-of-hand when a corp caught wind of what you’d put together, and started trying to poach this “preem-tier exec” for themselves - but by then, you were out of the picture.", "A ride-along with a crew of Edgerunners on what was meant to be a run-of-the-mill gig. It went utterly, positively tits-up. Lead flying, tires screeching, blood everywhere - the whole nine yards. You barely made it out alive, but the hours of unfiltered combat footage were an absolute goldmine for you. A BD studio bought the content off you, and now you can relive that hell on earth whenever you like at your nearest theatre.", "Whatever it was, it never saw the light of day - but it would’ve brought down hellfire if you’d published. The suited figures you found waiting for you at your pad made the consequences of that pretty clear, however. You handed over everything you found, never saw them again - and it’s probably thanks to that decision that you’re not sitting at the bottom of the Morro Bay wearing concrete shoes.", "You put out a scathing review of a movie, a show, or a rocker’s latest album. Sadly, you didn’t account for their absolutely rabid fanbase. The psychofans threw bricks at your windows, yelled at you on the street, mailed bombs to your home - the usual schtick. It got so bad, you eventually had to move away, or at least invest in some protection.", "As a favour to a choom of yours, you put out a little something touting their business as the hottest spot in the neighbourhood, hoping to draw in some new customers. It did well - so well, in fact, that a local gang swung by and turned the place into their hideout. Your buddy’s biz has been booming ever since, but they’ve had to learn to turn the other cheek to a lot of fucked-up shit.",
        "Not a “story” per se. Someone was looking for a talented investigator and got hold of your deets, hiring you to find out if their mainline was cheating on them. Whether they were or weren’t, you uncovered a veritable spider web of intrigue and terrible life choices. It remains your biggest payday to date, however.", "A review of a local restaurant, where you made an off-hand joke about a “secret menu” that didn’t exist. At least, you thought as much - until the Fixer that owned the place came to your home with a pair of Solos, demanding to know how you found out about their side business. One way or another, though, you survived. If that Fixer’s still alive, chances are you both enjoy a laugh about that clusterfuck from time to time.", "A damning exposé on your local police precinct, complete with testimonies from victims of their corruption, evidence of their shady dealings with gangs and/or corps, and some shocking details on their captain’s personal life. You’ve been public enemy #1 to these cops ever since - but any Media worth a damn would take that as a compliment.", "A fluff piece on a local street kid who found and adopted a cat, nursing them back to health. The cat became a minor celebrity after you published the story, and you were encouraged to do follow-ups on the little guy. Not the most hard-hitting journalism, but it made people smile. No lean feat in this fucking city.", "A series of interviews with a local Rockerboy or band who you hung out with for a few months, documenting their hijinks and recording their gigs. Their career really took off after you published that story, and whether they admit it or not, you played a pivotal role in their success.", "A takedown piece on a corporate middle manager. The suit dropped off the face of the earth a few weeks after your story dropped, and despite your best efforts, you never found out what happened to them. Perhaps they lost their job. Perhaps they got flatlined. Perhaps you’ll never know."

But you got a pat on the back and a speech from the local government about the importance of your work. Then, you were assigned a new case - just like that. You and the team don’t talk about it.", "It was nothing really - some kid scratched up a corpo rat’s car. As far as you can tell, it was an accident, but the suit wanted retribution. They could never pay for the damages, even if they were estimated with any shred of accuracy. You saw someone just starting out in life begin it behind prison bars. You check their name in the database from time to time, and from what you can tell, it's only been downhill from there.", "DV case. You took it on as a favour to one person or another. It’s probably the hardest case you’ve ever had, and in the end it was hard to really tell who was the victim and who was the perpetrator. In reality, it wasn’t as simple as that. Hurt people hurt people, and the idea of the misery you know can be much more appealing than any unknown. Nothing came of it really, despite your best efforts.",

But you remember. Maybe even kept some evidence, just in case.", "A massive operation to take down a major player in the local crime world. You put in hours of work, you barely slept. Everyone was working overtime to get this win, and you couldn’t be more proud of your team. Shame that all the credit went to someone more… “personable.” You got a pizza party and a 5% discount at the local Oasis store. Yay.", "What was supposed to be a public shooting or a robbery gone wrong turned out to be something way above your paygrade. A cyberpsycho, chromed to the gills, tore through your squad like a pack of SynthJerky. You were one of a handful to make it out alive - and that was only thanks to MaxTac, when they finally showed up.", "A classic serial killer case. It came in the middle of a mind numbingly boring, monotonous period. Back then you were almost thankful for something interesting. And then the bodies started rolling in. People whose lives you got to hear about in excruciating detail - some good, plenty bad. None deserving of the treatment they underwent. You’ve never complained about a boring spell ever since.",
        "Missing Persons case. The longer you investigated the more clear it became that the missing person might have disappeared on purpose, and with good reason. That most likely, someone gathered their resources and skipped town, away from abuse, toxicity and utter misery that was likely never going to change. You never found them, and on bad days, that thought comforts you.", "A street level fraud cause. Maybe it was some hack selling a miracle cure to the poorest of the poor. Or maybe it was someone selling really shady knock off cyberware. Or “real” food that turned out to be inedible. Either way, nobody really cared until some more wealthy clients started getting hurt, ending up in clinics and hospitals. You had to uncover a scam that was years in the making. An impressive operation if it wasn’t absolutely disgusting.", "An actual terrorist attack. One group of “activists” “freedom fighters” or “vigilantes” set up an explosive underneath a corporate building. A small corp, one you have never heard of before. It going off would have caused endless casualties, mostly of people who were just trying to make it from one paycheck to the next. You managed to prevent a disaster that day.", "You and another officer answered a call about someone acting suspiciously in a crowded public area. What you found there was a terrified young man or woman strapped with an explosive vest, courtesy of one of the local gangs. The bomb squad was on another call at the time, so rather than praying for them to arrive, you took it upon yourself to help this poor bastard. Whether you saved them or were forced to abandon them, that day has rooted itself in your grey matter, and perhaps most maddeningly - you still don’t know who put them in that vest, or why.", 
        "You were part of an armed escort for a very unpopular politician visiting NC, driving them from A to B for the duration of their stay. It wasn’t until you were driving them back to the border that a sniper in the Badlands started popping shots at your car with a high-powered rifle, killing everyone inside except you and the VIP. You sat in the bulletproofed car together, surrounded by corpses, for what felt like an eternity, as rounds bounced off the armoured plating of your boiling coffin, baking under the midday sun. Eventually, reinforcements arrived and the shooter moved on, but your comrades never caught the assassin.", "You worked with a confidential informant for a decent stretch of time - a member of a local gang who wanted out and was feeding you intel in exchange for a pardon and a fresh start. You pushed them for more and more info, constantly promising that their escape was “just around the corner”. They just needed to do one last thing. It wasn’t until they went missing after your latest demand that you realised you’d overstepped. They showed up a week later, hanging by their feet from an overpass in your precinct, naked, stripped of chrome, and decapitated. Just part of the job, or your responsibility? That was up to you.", "You were on the trail of an X-BD outfit for a good long while - psychos looking to make a quick eddie by scrolling some shit that still features front-and-centre in your nightmares. Always on the move, obsessed with privacy, and nearly impossible to trace. You fought tooth and nail for every last scrap of evidence, building a solid case with your blood, sweat and tears. Then, a day after you requested a team to follow you in there and take them down, your captain pulled you into their office, and ordered you to hand over your files and drop the case. You complied, to keep your badge - but snuck one piece of evidence out of the precinct; a constant reminder of the work you put in and the monsters who got away.", 
        "You were part of a team sent to help a well-known celebrity whose baby was being held for ransom by boostergangers. They had no intention of negotiating with thugs, and before long, you were trading shots with heavily-armed, chromed-up street punks in some quiet corner of the city, clearing the place room-by-room and even taking a few bullets before you found the hostage. As it turns out, this celebrity’s “baby” was a dog - worth a fortune, sure, but not quite what you’d expected. It pissed on you as thanks for your heroic rescue."

And sure, you had to spend a truckload of blood, sweat and tears to lose your fist around your prize. But damn if it didn’t feel good. Some folks who’ve heard what you did are counting the days until you turn up dead in a dumpster, or just pity your naivete - but others smile when you pass them on the street, and a few edgerunners here and there clearly respect you for what you did. That said, watch your back. You never know just how personally your old foe might have taken this.", "You’ve been going through a bit of a slump, lately. Several deals have turned sour at the drop of a hat, and the mercs you’ve hired have turned out to be everything from piss-stained street trash playing soldier to… well, corpses. A stain like that is tough to wash out, and your career as a Fixer is balancing on the edge of a knife. People will still give you the benefit of the doubt, so long as the eddies are rolling in, but hit even a single snag, and all of a sudden, it’ll be all your fault.",
        "You managed to put together a crew and pull off an incredible gig. Your squad were absolute professionals all the way through, and it was thanks to that - and a solid-gold run of good luck - that you made it out the other side without a single tech-hair out of place. Now, though, everyone’s looking at you; whether it’s to bear witness to your next big score, or get a front-row seat to the moment the world finally catches up with you.", "You very publicly, very messily flatlined someone. They might have been a business rival - or maybe it was a little more personal than that - but you brutalised them in a spectacular manner. The most flattering stories about that event paint you as someone unafraid of getting their hands dirty. The worst ones? They paint you as a full-on cyberpsycho, ready to make scop out of someone’s innards for misstepping within ten blocks of you. Who’s to say which one - if either - is true?", "One of your folks was/is a fixer, and everyone knows that this makes you a nepo-baby who only got to where they are through the achievements of their blood relatives. Nobody would say it, of course - not out loud. But you know what people whisper behind closed doors. You can tell from the way they look at you. If you want to be respected, if you want to be taken seriously in any capacity, you’re gonna have to do something spectacular.", "You’re known for working very closely with a particular gang. On one hand it’s fine, people are less likely to fuck with you in the fear of pissing off your chooms. On the other, it means most people who come to you are gang-affiliated, or are looking for some kind of “in” with them. Branching out and diversifying your portfolio is going to prove tricky.",
        "You’re known for a personal scandal. Maybe you had an affair that went very public. Maybe a loved one went cyberpsycho and had to be put down by MaxTac. Maybe your family got involved in some seriously shady biz. Whatever happened, when your name pops up, that ugly chapter is the first thing on everyone’s minds - even if they don’t always say it out loud.", "Whenever your name is mentioned, another name’s never far behind - a big one. Whoever it is, you’ve well and truly caught their attention. You might have done something - intentional or otherwise - to really piss them off. You might have stumbled your way into their biz and left it better than you found it, and now they’re looking to work with you. You might have woken up after one too many cans of smash with a pounding headache and a local celebrity in your bed. Having your reputation tied to somebody else’s isn’t ideal, but hey - maybe this can be the start of something special, however awkward that first step was.", "You klepped something - or perhaps more accurately, pulled together a crew to do so. Whatever it was, it’s not some random trinket. This merch is worth its weight in gold. Unfortunately, the previous owner seems to agree, and they haven’t let it go, putting every ounce of their considerable resources towards getting it back and zeroing you for your trouble - along with anyone who had so much as a pinky toe dipped in this mess. The worst part? You can’t even sell it; not through your usual channels, anyway. No buyer in town with half a brain cell would risk taking that off your hands. It might as well be radioactive. You’re being hunted - you and your crew. They might have even gotten to one of your chooms already. The best you can do right now is keep your head down and be rid of the fucking thing ASAP. Whatever you do, be very, very careful who you show it to. It might not be the best move to let the whole city know you have it.",
        "An assassination - one with really bad optics. You didn’t pull the trigger yourself, but you found the right Solo for the job. Capable, discreet - and apparently, lacking any goddamn morals. Turns out, you weren’t given the full story when it came to your target. They were a victim of someone this neighbourhood fucking despises - a gang boss, a corp, or some other piece of trash. By the time you found out, it was too late to call it off, and now the whole street knows you set your triggerman on the poor bastard. Your client is grateful, however, so maybe you don’t give a rat’s ass. Your neighbours don’t pay your salary, and while they hate your guts, they’re not gonna touch you. To them, you’re the Grim Fucking Reaper.", "You took the chance to do the right thing - a rare opportunity in this city. Or maybe you just suffered a recent blow to the head and lost your business sense. Whatever your reasons, you offered your services to someone without an enny to their name - took them by the hand and marched them out of hell. Naturally, word got around, and while the Street adores you for it, you’ve gotten visits from similarly hopeless cases ever since. Like it or not, as far as some folks are concerned, you’re not running a business anymore - you’re running a charity.", "You’re exactly what it says on the tin - you’re a Fixer. You make problems go away. You find that old lady’s son who went missing while getting high with his choombas. You make sure nobody smashes up that street vendor’s stall ever again. You keep your neighbourhood clean - as clean as you can, anyway. You can’t exactly do this without stepping on a lot of powerful toes, of course, but the folks around you have got your back. Here’s hoping they don’t have to protect it from .50 rounds any time soon. 60-year-old Nancy and her novelty spoon collection aren’t exactly bulletproof.",
        "Folks see you as a bit of a sleaze, but you do just enough good in the neighbourhood to be tolerated - intentionally or not. To hear the Street tell it, there’s no trade you won’t exploit to make a quick eurobuck. It’s all about the money - no matter what you’re doing, or who’s getting hurt along the way. An unfair assessment? Only you know for sure how close they are to the truth.", "Someone somewhere owes you big-time, and you’re not gonna stop until you collect. Whatever you did for them, or what they did to you, this isn’t a debt you can just leave unpaid. Unfortunately, the locals aren’t especially helpful. Whether out of a fear of them or a dislike of you - or both - folks seem to clam-up whenever you mention their name, and it’s starting to get to you. Maybe a change of strategy is in order - if you’ve got the stomach for it.", "You’re nobody - an unknown, a shadow on the wall. People in this city don’t know you - not really. Maybe they know you by some pseudonym or another - maybe they’ve heard a thing or two about the gigs you’ve put together over the years - but they couldn’t pick you out of a line-up if you had a neon tattoo on your forehead that said “IT’S ME”. Perhaps this bothers you… or perhaps this is exactly how you like it."

You’re pretty sure whatever your Pack has you doing to “make it up to them” is just an excuse to get rid of you for a while.", "One of your Pack has gone missing.

You’re here to pay off that particular debt. You need to do well, and make sure your family doesn't get caught up in any more than they already have.", "Somebody stole from the Pack. They took something valuable, and are unlikely to give it back if someone just asks nicely. So, your job is to find the fucker who klepped from your family, make mince of their grey matter and bring what’s rightfully yours back home.", "You’ve been sent away to gather intel. Whether you’re spying on a Corp or a gang, or even a specific individual, you’re meant to find out all you can - any weaknesses, exploits, or connections. When you have enough, you’ll report to the Pack and await further instructions.", "A rival Pack is doing biz in the city. If they gain allies amongst the statics, that's bad news for you and your lot. So, you and a couple others from the Pack have been sent into the city to not only disrupt any attempts made by the rival Pack, but also make a good impression on some powerful folks -  maybe even secure some allies and resources for your own Pack.", "Apparently, there are some people looking to leave the static life behind. You’ve been sent to vet them, make sure all is in order and - if they prove themselves - introduce them to the family. Be careful, though. If you give the green light, anything they do or fail to do will be on your head - for better or worse.", "You were sent into the city to re-supply before the Pack heads out again. There’s just… one tiny problem. You gambled, drank or fucked away all the hard-earned cred you were given - or perhaps you simply lost it; which, let’s be honest, would be more embarrassing. Now, you have to scrounge up every eddie you can before they realise what you did. You’re working overtime and lying your ass off to make sure this doesn’t get out.",
        "Your leader brought the Pack here on a personal initiative. Apparently they’re here to touch base with an old friend. In the meantime, some able bodies were needed to go into town and try to scrounge up some work - or at least snatch-up something to make the trip worth it. You drew the short straw, and here you are.", "You gave the Pack your fair share of reasons for taking a trip away, but man would they be pissed - or piss themselves laughing - if they knew what was really going on. The truth is… you’re just so goddamn bored. Hopefully this little vacation breathes a touch more excitement into your life.", "It’s embarrassing to admit, but… you’re here to meet someone. A static. You’ve been chatting however and whenever you can for a while now, and they finally invited you to meet IRL. Is that nerves, or excitement? Could be both. Dear god - are they even real? They’d better be fucking real.", "Your Pack is dying. Whether it’s sickness, one too many raids, or simple starvation, you’re one of several able-bodied clanmates who were chosen to go hunting for a solution. Your search led you to a few spots before you found your way here. This place is your last chance. You’re running out of time.", "Your actions have caught the attention of some powerful, dangerous people. You couldn’t live with yourself if the consequences touched your family, so you left. Maybe it’s not forever - just a brief vacation to get this shit squared away, and then you can go home.", "Whether it was a Corp, a Fixer, or a gang, someone sent you an offer that you couldn’t refuse. Not wanting to implicate your Pack, you struck out on your own and found your way here, ready to hear them out.", "You don’t actually know what you’re doing in this town - not yet, anyway. Your Pack’s leader told you to split away and come here, then await further instructions. Someone should be passing you the deets any day now. With so much secrecy surrounding this, though… it has to be something big.", "Someone fucked your Pack over in a biblical way, and your family’s wrath has followed them all the way here. But a horde of Nomads can’t exactly flood into the city - not safely or discreetly, anyway - so you’ve been sent ahead to find the prick and bring them to your clan. Let justice be done.",
        "Someone in your Pack died recently - someone very close to you. A lover, a parent - even a best friend. Something broke inside you when it happened, and you couldn’t stand to be there anymore. You packed your things in the middle of the night and left without a word. You don’t know if you’re ever going back.", "Whatever you did - and whether you’re actually guilty - your Pack couldn’t forgive you. You were scarred or branded and left for dead - a Raffen Shiv.
